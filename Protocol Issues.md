## Observation for undefined structures

### Date
In the case of tree-hollows, which are nested in trees, it is probably assumed that all hollows in the tree are being surveyed. The date of first observation can be referred to as the date of first observation of the tree. This was the case for one of my trial strucutres, _\_*BoxBase_. 

Looking at the tree is a necessary technique, because demanding that hollows be defined is too strenuous.

### List of structures surveyed
It may be necessary to take a similar approach to that applied to hollows (nest-site structures) above, but for whole trees (meta-structures). In this application, the tree is nested in a survey area. If the surveyor is confident that they are capturing each tree in an area, and that their survey definition is fair given that assumption, then they should be at liberty to backlog the observation dates on those structures.
