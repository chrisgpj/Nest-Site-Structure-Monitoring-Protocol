# Information System Overview

## A Note on The Concept of Layers

A 'Layer' is some piece of information that occupies a unique place in the information system. This space can be thought of as a multidimensional plane, with the dimensions being the real-world dimensions that we interact with, rather than the dimensions that may be suggested by variable in the data set. The definition of a habitat structure are focused in space, and fairly stable in time. Notes on the use of the habitat structre are more time-sensitive (used one month, and not the next!), and also respond sharply to time (fledglings are off today!). The use of the habitat structure is really, on a time scale, nested _within_ the habitat strucutre - this is one way of distinguishing a layer. Notes on activity of wildlife at a site are similar in how they are instantaneous in time and constantly in flux, but they pertain to a spatial scale which is much larger than habitat structres. This is another way of distinguishing a layer. Layers can be far more abstract, but that discussion is not one I am capable of, or one that can be expounded here in any case.

## Gerneral Considerations

- Compare and reference nest recording scheme:
https://www.birdlife.org.au/projects/atlas-and-birdata/nest-record-scheme
- What is measured is a different question to how it is measured.
- What is linked to the structure, what is not linked or nebulously linked?
  - To narrow down, or broaden out?
  - How will cross-reference be achieved?
- What things are static for the unit of observation, what are things that may change
  - Is this different to observations being regularly repeated?
- The unit of observation is the habitat structure, but there are also units of observations which are visits to sites and nest box locations
- What is the most genral scale for observation and what is the most specific scale? see notes in 'Layers'.
- What of borderlands?

## Layer Considerations

- Sites and areas
- Habitat structure and its data
-  Observations of the habitat structure and it's occupancy at a point in time
- Observations of wildlife which may be deemed relevant to different scales, inclding site and habitat structure.

## Layer Information Fields

### Sites and areas
- Description of site to clarify location
-  Representative group
- Types of habitats present
- [note that overview of projects not needed for nest boxes as this system _is_ the overview.]

### Habitat Strucutre

- Unique Name (also indicated strucutre type)
- Date 'installed'
- Date first observed
- Informal Notes on past use (standardised terminology)
- Cross reference to past habitat strucutre Unique Name
- History (standardised terminology)
- Key photo and other photos - Y/N once syncronised.
- ~~Dated notes of use signs by wildlife(standardised language)~~
- Dated notes of condition of stucutre(standardised language) [1]

### Habitat structure Occupancy

- date, time
- Survey type (stanardised terminology)
- Signs of use (absence also noted)
- Occupancy (absence also noted)
- Activity, including breeding behaviour ('no further signs', 'not surveyed', and 'ambiguous' noted)

## Notes
[1] Need prompts to keep these! Possibly a meta-layer is needed to coordinate observation schedules?
