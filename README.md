# Welcome to the Habitat Nest and Shelter Site Monitoring Protocol

## Quick Introduction

The files in this repository are a small subset of those that I have been working on locally. They were not necessarily intended to be shared in this form â€” but I did want to make this project collaborative, and I have decided that this means being open to sharing work in draft form.

For some broad thoughts on the scope and principles of the protocol please see the folder "Work on the Protocol" and the file "Broad Thoughts and Principles.md". This is a positioning essay and will serve as an introduction to the project. It does need a hard edit. I will get to it soon.

There is now also some meta-data in the 'work on the Protocol' folder. The meta-data speaks to the more detailed workings of the protocol. I am not sure how useful this is to other people at the moment.
