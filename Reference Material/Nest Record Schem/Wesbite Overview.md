[The following is from the birdlife webpage for the nest recording scheme (there is no other informative text on that page]

The Nest Record Scheme is BirdLife Australia's longest-running bird survey, documenting all aspects of bird breeding throughout Australia. In this it has been very successful, and its contribution can be seen in any recent breeding text in our Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds (HANZAB). Often the Scheme is the only source of basic biological information such as breeding season, description of nest and nest location, clutch size, incubation and fledging periods, parental care and behaviour, and breeding success.

You can record as little or as much detail as you like - even records of fledglings out of the nest can be submitted. The main thing is to record what you see, before this information is lost from memory or hidden away in notebooks, so that it can contribute to our understanding of breeding in Australian birds.

Anyone can participate, and forms are available for download below or by mail.

Send completed NRS forms to the Atlas project.
