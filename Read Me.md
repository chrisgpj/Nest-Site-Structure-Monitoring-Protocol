# Welcome to the Repository for the Habitat Nest and Shelter Site Monitoring Protocl

## Qucik Introducton

The files in this repository are a subset of those that I have been working on locally. They were not necessarily intended to be shared in this form, but I did want to make this project collaborative, and I have decided that this means being open to sharing work that is in draft form.

For some broad thoughts on the scope and principles of the protocol, and thereby the entire project, please see the folder "Work on the Protocol" and the file "Broad Thoughts and Principles.md"
